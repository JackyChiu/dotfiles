## JackyChiu's dotfiles
Trying out a new workflow with tmux+vim <br/>
*Disclamer*: Most configs were found online and I picked whichever I found useful

## Installing
If you want to checkout my enviroment you can use my setup script or manually copy paste all the dotfiles into your `~` dir
 
	git clone https://github.com/JackyChiu/dotfiles.git
	cd dotfiles
	./setup.sh

If you don't have Vundle for vim installed in your `.vim` dir

    git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

Install plugins for vim

    vim ~/.vimrc
    :PluginInstall

*Side note*: Mouse seting commands for .tmux.conf only work with tmux 2.1 +
